Final Report:

1. Project goals and core functionality.
   The project is a distributed and replicated database application. The functionality is to ensure high availability and fault tolerance through replicating the data to distinct services that can recover in case of downtime as long as at least one node survives.

## REPORT WRITING GUIDLINE

Final report (20 points)
Final report must be in line with design plan (changes are normal, all major changes must be documented
as appendix), program code and the video. If there are issues in this, it will be notified in the grading of the
final report. Final report must also have table of contents.
In addition to cover page and table of content the final report must address:

1. The projectâ€™s goal(s) and core functionality. Identifying the applications / services that can build on
   your project.
2. The design principles (architecture, process, communication) techniques.

   - This is typically the main part of the report, because it documents the system design and
     maps it with the source code

3. What functionalities does your system provide? For instance, naming and node discovery,
   consistency and synchronization, fault tolerance and consensus?
4. How do you show that your system can scale to support the increased number of nodes?
5. How do you quantify the performance of the system and what did you do (can do) to improve the
   performance of the system (for instance reduce the latency or improve the throughput)?
6. The key enablers and the lessons learned during the development of the project.
7. Appendix: Describe how the project differs from the design plan. This is more for your own
   reflection, and deviations from the initial design plan will not be penalized. However, a complete
   change in project plan (if any) must be described.
   The grading of the final report will be split among the topics so that parts 1&2 together will give you 1-8
   points and the rest 1-3 points each.
   Please notice that some elements (like design principles, scalability, performance, etc. can also explained in
   video or commented in the source code, in such a case please mention in the final report. (This should be
   done simply to ensure that you are graded fairly. If you do not mention that, it is possible that you lose
   some points because the information was not in the final document.)
